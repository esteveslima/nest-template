  - **`nest generate controller <CONTROLLER_NAME> --no-spec`**               > Create new controller in current module(without module tests)
  - **`nest generate service <SERVICE_NAME> --no-spec`**                     > Create new service in current module(without module tests)

TODO: list topics to be commented on this readme
 - .
 - "clean architecture", separation of concerns, error handling
 - providers and custom providers
   - injectable classes can be marked as providers for modules
   - for custom values(e.g.: npm packages) it should be wrapped as a custom provider to allow DI and also inject manually with it's token value
 - logs
   - interceptor
   - pino logger module(reqId on all logs for request session)
 - db
   - only access to data is through repository
   - possible to have multiple databases and select by name
 - doc
   - GET /swagger on brouser to access live doc
   - GET /api/graphql on browser to access graphql playground with live schema
   - describe dir structure with: https://medium.com/codex/clean-architecture-for-dummies-df6561d42c94#ce42
 - auth
   - authentication & authorization built on the guard to simplify applying with decorators
 - graphql
   - for graphql can applied auth guard on entire methods(query/mutations) as well as only on fields(which use a custom interceptor to get user info and a field middleware to limit access only on "private" fields, creating a model with mixed permissions)
